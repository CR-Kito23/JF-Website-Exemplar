          <h3>The lore of Risk of Rain 2 is given in the form of logs, found by the player in various ways, such as kiling an enemy, finding an item, or going to an enviornment. The logs are like lore puzzle pieces, only giving the reader a snippet of information, letting the reader piece together the lore for themselves. These logs are the most important in understanding the general story of Risk of Rain 2, they tell the tale of two brothers, Mithrix and Providence. Mithrix is the final boss in Risk of Rain 2, while Providence is the final boss in the first Risk of Rain.</h3>

          <h3>My brother, it is done. Come! See! 
          <br>
          Look to the moon... the first beacon shines brightly on the other side! There was no gap in its sequence - it has traveled instantaneously. We can cross the dark sea without succumbing to its sickness if we simply do not travel through it at all - is it not a brilliant light of hope? 
          <br>
          <br>
          Only your hands could have realized my design, brother. I feel truly now that there is no obstacle nor force we cannot overcome together - with my designs, and your constructions. While it pains me to see your heart still torn for the doomed, we are not among them. There is an entire cosmos for us. We can escape this planet. Our prison. If your heart truly yearns to save... then surely more of our kind awaits among the other worlds - trapped by the dark sea. 
          <br>
          <br>
          And to them we can offer the gates. 
          <br>
          <br>
          When next she visits our world I must ask her to take a gate with her. Perhaps dozens! You should be celebrating with me, brother!
          <br>
          <br>
          ... And yet I see your somber gaze will not lift. Please, take the gate. Step foot on another world. Reap the rewards of your toil. Prove to the universe you are free! I cannot bear to see you in such a pitiable mood on such a joyous occasion.
          <br>
          <br>
          ...
          <br>
          <br>
          If you insist, brother, I will go first. Forget about those creatures - and do not dawdle. I want to see joy on your face.</h3>

          <h3>It is sealed… you do not have the skill to release this - it is a lock of my design. MY DESIGN. It will not break, and it will not yield. The alignment of the gate cannot now be changed by one such as you. It will persist for as long my treacherous brother lives. I have wasted my time in teaching you to operate it.
          <br>
          <br>
          A lock… MY lock… crafted by the hands of my betrayer!
          <br>
          <br>
          He has exploited and twisted my treasured designs into mockeries. 
          <br>
          <br>
          MY guardians, that he continues to weave with willful volatility.
          <br>
          <br>
          MY sentinels, that he encumbers by his self-indulgent adornments and alterations. 
          <br>
          <br>
          MY GATES, through which vermin like you ride to our infested home. Vermin, like you… oblivious to her sacrifice, as you all cowered from the radiant corpse that saved you. And now, in the greatest mockery he could devise, he has twice used my own creations to erase me. My heart cannot bear this.
          <br>
          <br>
          My blood boils anew... And I will no longer be able temper it.
          <br>
          <br>
          Your final task is rescinded.
          <br>
          <br>
          You have served me well. You have been my hands where I cannot reach, my feet where I cannot stride. My eyes, where I cannot see. And I have seen enough. Be pleased that I hold loyalty above all else.
          <br>
          <br>
          When you so choose, the beads of your oath will guide you to my vault. Reach out to the monolith while clutching them. Do not let go. You will find yourself at peace, and more importantly, my servant, in a realm overlooked by the design of my coming reprisal.</h3>

          <h3>The key is incredibly simple. A stone crescent, with little discernable detail to the naked eye. But if one looks closer, with a sight beyond sight, they may notice the patterns inscribed on the key’s being. The patterns tell many things:
          <br>
          <br>
          The key’s function: to unlock a lost trove of abandoned treasure.
          <br>
          <br>
          The key’s creators: two brothers, one composed of ambition and the other compassion.
          <br>
          <br>
          The key’s hopes: infused into the key, deep within its core, is a memory of better times, and the hope that one day, perhaps things could be better again.
          <br>
          <br>
          The key’s reality: the bitter realization that such a reality exists only in the past.</h3>

          <h3>Brother, what is this...? Why is it misshapen and weak? Was there an error in my design?
          <br>
          <br>
          Guardian. Come to me. Allow me to see your construction.
          <br>
          <br>
          ...
          <br>
          <br>
          So I see.
          <br>
          <br>
          These are not the correct ratios.
          <br>
          <br>
          This is no minor error, Brother. You have purposefully deviated from the design. For what purpose have you done this? You cannot weave a construct from such an abundance of soul. You know it is too unstable - that it is too unpredictable and too frail. I have told you this, and yet you have wasted the materials I have gathered - and exhausted your own strength to fabricate this miscreation.
          <br>
          <br>
          To what benefit?
          <br>
          <br>
          At its best, it can be no more than an inferior servant; it is deficient in the compounds that were to give it fortitude and strength. At its worst, it will betray us.
          <br>
          <br>
          You have created the first being of this world which threatens us. We cannot keep it here. Attempting to destroy it will risk its retaliation... I will prepare one of the vaults for it to be sealed away, while it is still young and naive.
          <br>
          <br>
          What a foolish mistake you have made, brother.
          <br>
          <br>
          I expect you to return the design to me. I cannot allow you to build another construct with so much power - and with such little control. I will build the rest of our guardians; by my hand, they will be weak, but at least they will be loyal.
          <br>
          <br>
          Go home. I will deal with this creature. We can discuss a better project for you when I return.</h3>

          <br>
          <br>
          They threw in dirt and stone and kifruit and starseed, watching as they collapsed. Thorp! The gravity wells would swallow up anything. Glass and mud and silver. Wind. Heat. Pulsar radiation.
          <br>
          <br>
          And when his brother wasn’t watching, Mithrix would throw in worms. Thorp! But only when he wasn’t watching. You see, his brother loved worms. It would make him sad. But Mithrix didn’t care much about worms. He was just curious.
          <br>
          <br>
          But one time, his brother was watching. And his brother loved worms.</h3>

          <br>
          <br>
          We begin with stone, silver, and fire. Take note of the ratios.
          <br>
          <br>
          High speed. Speed is war. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Twin cannons – with twin exhausts. We stream their exhausts, for volatility.
          <br>
          <br>
          Quadrupeds are easier, and more stable. We maintain that.
          <br>
          <br>
          And that, dear brother, is it. No dance. No song. These guardians do not need soul.</h3>
